# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources:

1.  [Register of Members' Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/),
2.  [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
3.  [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/).

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration's interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project's methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).

## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}
 con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(con)
```
Problem 3: What plane (specified by the tailnum variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please left_join() the resulting table with the table planes (also included in the nycflights13 package).

```{r, risk_return, echo=FALSE}
#| label: problem-3

# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

# Filter flights for New York City airports and the year 2013 and that 
filtered_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(substr(year, 1, 4) == "2013" & !is.na(tailnum))

# Count the number of occurrences of each tail number
tailnum_counts <- filtered_flights %>%
  count(tailnum)

# Sort the counts in descending order
sorted_tailnum_counts <- tailnum_counts %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

#Join with planes to get planes >50 

sorted_tailnum_50_counts <- sorted_tailnum_counts %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum", na_matches = "never") %>%
  filter(seats > 50)


# Retrieve the tail number with the highest count
most_frequent_plane <- sorted_tailnum_50_counts$tailnum[1]

# Display the results
most_frequent_plane

# Get the plane with the greatest number of flights and more than 50 seats
selected_plane <- planes %>%
  filter(seats > 50 & tailnum == most_frequent_plane)

# Filter flights for the selected plane in 2013
selected_flights <- filtered_flights %>%
  filter(tailnum == most_frequent_plane)

# Display the results
selected_flights

# Count flights by destination
flight_counts_by_dest <- selected_flights %>%
  count(dest) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Output the result
flight_counts_by_dest

```
