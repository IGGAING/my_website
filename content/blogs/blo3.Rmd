# Logical operators with flight database

Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:
-   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
-   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
-   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
-   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
-   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
-   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}
# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >= 2)
```

Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

```{r}
#| label: problem-2
#library(dplyr)

# What months had the highest and lowest % of cancelled flights?

# Calculate the percentage of cancelled flights per month
cancelled_flights_per_month <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total_flights = n(), 
            cancelled_flights = sum (is.na(dep_time))) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_cancelled = round(cancelled_flights / total_flights * 100,2))

# Display the results
cancelled_flights_per_month

# Find the month with the maximum and minimum percentage of cancelled flights
month_with_max_cancelled <- which.max(cancelled_flights_per_month$percentage_cancelled)
month_with_min_cancelled <- which.min(cancelled_flights_per_month$percentage_cancelled)

# Display the month with the maximum and minimum percentage of cancelled flights
cat("The month with the maximum percentage of cancelled flights was:", month.name[month_with_max_cancelled], "\n")
cat("The month with the minimum percentage of cancelled flights was:", month.name[month_with_min_cancelled], "\n")
```
Problem 3: What plane (specified by the tailnum variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please left_join() the resulting table with the table planes (also included in the nycflights13 package).

```{r, risk_return, echo=FALSE}
#| label: problem-3

# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

# Filter flights for New York City airports and the year 2013 and that 
filtered_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(substr(year, 1, 4) == "2013" & !is.na(tailnum))

# Count the number of occurrences of each tail number
tailnum_counts <- filtered_flights %>%
  count(tailnum)

# Sort the counts in descending order
sorted_tailnum_counts <- tailnum_counts %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

#Join with planes to get planes >50 

sorted_tailnum_50_counts <- sorted_tailnum_counts %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum", na_matches = "never") %>%
  filter(seats > 50)


# Retrieve the tail number with the highest count
most_frequent_plane <- sorted_tailnum_50_counts$tailnum[1]

# Display the results
most_frequent_plane

# Get the plane with the greatest number of flights and more than 50 seats
selected_plane <- planes %>%
  filter(seats > 50 & tailnum == most_frequent_plane)

# Filter flights for the selected plane in 2013
selected_flights <- filtered_flights %>%
  filter(tailnum == most_frequent_plane)

# Display the results
selected_flights

# Count flights by destination
flight_counts_by_dest <- selected_flights %>%
  count(dest) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Output the result
flight_counts_by_dest

```
