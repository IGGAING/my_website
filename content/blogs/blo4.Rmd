# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as an open-source database for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

# Obtain the data


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


mass_shootings <- read_csv(here::here("data", "mass_shootings.csv"))

glimpse(mass_shootings)
```

Explore the data

Specific questions

Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}
# Group the data by year and count the number of shootings
shootings_per_year <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Shootings = n())

# View the resulting data frame
print(shootings_per_year)
```
Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r, risk_return, echo=FALSE}
#ibrary(ggplot2)

# Create a custom color palette
my_colors <- c("White" = "#FF9999", "Black" = "#666666", "Asian" = "#FFCC99", "Other" = "#3399FF")

# Reorder the data frame by the number of shooters in descending order and eliminate the NA
mass_shootings %>% 
  count(race, sort=TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na(race) %>% 
  mutate(race = fct_reorder(race, n)) %>% 
  
  
# Create the bar chart with ordered bars and custom colors
  ggplot( aes(x = race, y = n, fill = race)) +
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of Shooters") +
  ggtitle("Number of Mass Shooters by Race") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Create the bar chart with ordered bars and custom colors in the other way from max to min
ggplot(mass_shootings %>% 
         count(race, sort = TRUE) %>% 
         drop_na(race) %>% 
         mutate(race = fct_reorder(race, n)),
       aes(x = reorder(race, -n), y = n, fill = race)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of Shooters") +
  ggtitle("Number of Mass Shooters by Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
